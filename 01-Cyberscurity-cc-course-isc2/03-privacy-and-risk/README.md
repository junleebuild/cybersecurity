# 03 - Privacy and Risk

## 📘 Overview

Today's lesson covered two essential topics in cybersecurity: **Privacy** and **Risk Management**. This section introduces the key risk concepts and performance indicators used in governance and decision-making.

## 🔐 Privacy
- **Definition**: The right of individuals to control how their personal data is collected, used, shared, and stored.
- **Key Concepts**:
  - **PII (Personally Identifiable Information)**: Any data that can identify an individual (e.g., name, SSN, email).
  - **Data Minimization**: Only collecting what’s necessary.
  - **User Consent**: Individuals must agree before data is used.

## ⚠️ Risk Concepts

### 🔸 What is Risk?
- **Risk** = Threat × Vulnerability × Impact  
  (The potential for loss or damage when a threat exploits a vulnerability)

### 🔸 Types of Risk
- **Total Risk**: All possible risk in the absence of any controls.
- **Residual Risk**: Remaining risk after applying security controls.
- **Acceptable Risk**: The amount of residual risk that is tolerable to the organization.

### 📊 Risk Assessment Methods

| Type | Description | Example |
|------|-------------|---------|
| **Qualitative Risk** | Based on subjective judgment (e.g., high/medium/low) | "Phishing risk: High" |
| **Quantitative Risk** | Based on numerical values | "Expected annual loss: $50,000" |

## 🧠 Risk-Related Terms

| Term | Meaning | Example |
|------|--------|---------|
| **AV (Asset Value)** | Cost to replace or protect an asset | A server worth $10,000 |
| **EF (Exposure Factor)** | % of damage if a threat occurs | Fire damages 60% → EF = 0.6 |
| **SLE (Single Loss Expectancy)** | Loss from a single event = AV × EF | $10,000 × 0.6 = $6,000 |
| **ARO (Annual Rate of Occurrence)** | How often an event happens in a year | Once every 2 years → ARO = 0.5 |
| **ALE (Annual Loss Expectancy)** | Expected yearly loss = SLE × ARO | $6,000 × 0.5 = $3,000 |
| **RCO (Risk Control Options)** | Ways to manage risk | Accept, Avoid, Transfer, Mitigate |

## 📈 Governance Metrics

| Term | Meaning | Use |
|------|--------|-----|
| **KGI (Key Goal Indicator)** | Measures goal achievement | "Complete ISO 27001 audit by Q3" |
| **KPI (Key Performance Indicator)** | Tracks performance toward a goal | "Avg. patch deployment time < 3 days" |
| **KRI (Key Risk Indicator)** | Signals rising risk levels | "Unpatched vulnerabilities > 100 = red alert" |
