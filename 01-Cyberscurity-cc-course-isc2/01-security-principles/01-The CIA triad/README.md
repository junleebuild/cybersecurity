# 01 - The CIA Triad

## ðŸ“˜ Overview

Todayâ€™s lesson focused on one of the most fundamental principles in cybersecurity: the **CIA Triad**, which stands for **Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability**. These three elements form the core objectives of any cybersecurity strategy.

---

### ðŸ”’ Confidentiality
- **Definition**: Ensuring that sensitive information is accessed only by authorized individuals.
- **Examples**:
  - Password protection and authentication systems
  - Data encryption (e.g., AES, RSA)
  - Access control mechanisms and role-based access
  - Multi-factor authentication (MFA)
- **Goal**: To prevent data breaches, leaks, or exposure to unauthorized parties.

---

### ðŸ§© Integrity
- **Definition**: Protecting information from being altered or tampered with in unauthorized ways.
- **Examples**:
  - Hash functions (SHA-256, MD5)
  - Checksums and parity bits
  - Digital signatures
  - Version control systems (e.g., Git)
- **Goal**: To ensure that data remains accurate, complete, and trustworthy.

---

### ðŸ•’ Availability
- **Definition**: Ensuring that authorized users can access the information and systems they need when they need them.
- **Examples**:
  - Redundant systems and failover mechanisms
  - Load balancing and distributed systems
  - DDoS protection and mitigation tools
  - Cloud-based backup and recovery
- **Goal**: To minimize downtime and maintain service continuity.

## ðŸ§  Key Takeaways

- The CIA Triad is the foundation of all cybersecurity practices.
- Each component addresses a unique set of threats and must be balanced.
- Real-world attacks often target one or more aspects of the triad (e.g., ransomware impacts both integrity and availability).
