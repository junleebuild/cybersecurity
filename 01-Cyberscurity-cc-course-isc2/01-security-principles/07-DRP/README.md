# 07 - Disaster Recovery Planning (DRP)

## 📘 Overview

Today’s lesson focused on **Disaster Recovery Planning (DRP)**—a key part of Business Continuity that specifically addresses how to recover IT systems and data after an unexpected disruption.

---

## 🔄 What is DRP?

- **DRP** is a documented and tested strategy for restoring **IT infrastructure**, **applications**, and **data** after:
  - Natural disasters
  - Cyber attacks (ransomware, DDoS)
  - Hardware/software failures
  - Human error

---

## 🧩 DRP Components

| Component | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Recovery Objectives** | Define recovery goals (RTO, RPO) |
| **MOR (Minimum Operating Requirements)** | The minimum level of service needed for operations |
| **Testing and Maintenance** | Regular DRP drills and updates |
| **Communication Plan** | Notify stakeholders and coordinate recovery |

---

## 🕒 RTO vs RPO

| Term | Definition | Example |
|------|------------|---------|
| **RTO (Recovery Time Objective)** | How quickly must the system be back online? | "Within 4 hours" |
| **RPO (Recovery Point Objective)** | How much data loss is acceptable? | "No more than 15 minutes of data lost" |

---

## 🏢 Recovery Site Types

| Site Type | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Hot Site** | Fully operational backup site—immediate switchover | Expensive, fast |
| **Warm Site** | Partially equipped—some setup needed | Moderate cost and time |
| **Cold Site** | Basic facility only—systems must be set up from scratch | Cheap, slow recovery |

---

## 🧠 Key Takeaways

- **DRP focuses on IT recovery** — complementing BCP’s business-wide focus.
- Organizations must balance **cost vs speed** when choosing site types.
- Regular **testing** is crucial—an untested DRP is unreliable.
