# 04 - Access Control: Categories & Types

## ðŸ“˜ Overview

Todayâ€™s session focused on **Access Control**â€”how access to systems and data is regulated, managed, and enforced. We explored both control **categories** (by implementation method) and control **types** (by purpose).

## ðŸ—‚ Access Control Categories

| Category | Description | Examples |
|----------|-------------|----------|
| **Administrative** | Controls based on policies, procedures, and human factors | Security awareness training, hiring policies |
| **Technical** | Controls implemented through technology | Firewalls, IDS/IPS, authentication systems |
| **Physical** | Controls to restrict physical access | Key cards, locks, guards, CCTV |

## ðŸ”§ Access Control Types

| Type | Description | Examples |
|------|-------------|----------|
| **Preventive** | Blocks unwanted actions before they occur | Firewalls, password policies |
| **Detective** | Identifies incidents during or after they occur | IDS, audit logs |
| **Corrective** | Fixes issues after an incident | Software patches, backups |
| **Deterrent** | Discourages actions through visible measures | "Authorized personnel only" signs |
| **Recovery** | Restores systems after a disaster or failure | Disaster recovery plans, redundant systems |
| **Compensating** | Provides alternative protection when standard controls are not possible | Manual approvals, increased monitoring |

## ðŸ§  Key Takeaways

- Access controls are **layered** and work best when used together (Defense in Depth).
- A good security policy uses **multiple types and categories** to ensure full protection.
- Some controls serve **dual roles** (e.g., CCTV is both Detective and Deterrent).
